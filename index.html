            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kevin and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand.  
                I am learning web development as part of my software design course, but I also see these skills as valuable for my own 
                personal development going forward. So far, the main concept I have learned is HTML, which helped me understand how web pages 
                are structured and how content is organised for users.  
                I have also started learning how CSS can be used to improve the visual design and layout of a website.  
                My goal is to eventually build a solid, well-designed, and user-friendly web application.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to web development, I have also worked on a High Performance Computing project, which strengthened my practical 
                experience with Linux systems and automation. This project helped me improve my problem-solving and scripting skills, as well 
                as my ability to plan and design technical systems as part of a team. It also gave me a better understanding of how 
                large-scale computing environments are built and managed in real-world scenarios.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>

            <p>
                My latest project focused on High Performance Computing and was completed as part of a group project. 
                I worked on a Linux-based environment using the Ubuntu Server distribution, where we relied heavily on Bash scripting 
                to automate the compilation of applications from source, system configuration, and execution of benchmarking workloads. 
                My main contributions were developing the automation scripts and designing the network plan for the team. 
                As a result, we successfully built the system and benchmarked several high-performance computing applications to 
                evaluate and validate the cluster's performance.
